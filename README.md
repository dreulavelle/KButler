Program to clean up Kodi files and package it into a zip, then uploading it to Dropbox (or you can change it to your preferred builds location). Always adding improvements! This is mean't to be for those that are creating their own Kodi builds and takes out a lot of the packing/managing process. I'll add a better readme for it soon once it's done and it reaches version 1.0.
